                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                   My name is Joseph Prestipino, born and raised in Chicago, IL. My brain has always gravitated towards doing artistic things in my free time, or not so free time, such as drawing on my notebook instead of listening to a lecture. I've always struggled with procrastination and motivation, hell I'm writing this "About Me" section about 11 hours before deadline. However, I am always looking to work on myself and improve both in the world of art and in my personal life. </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                   I currently work on youtube montages of Valorant, a TAC-FPS I play on the Varsity team for my college. I've also worked with drawing in the past. If there is one thing I want you to take away from my portfolio, it's that I like to do things my own way first and foremost, and then hope other people like them afterwards.
